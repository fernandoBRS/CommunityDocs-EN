# Cloud-based predictive analytics with Azure Machine Learning

What if you could predict stock prices based on market movement? Or if patients would be at risk of developing certain conditions (like diabetes, asthma and heart disease)? Or even if you could detect fraud?
Machine Learning is a field of study that can be used to make such predictions. In this tutorial I will show how you can create a cloud-based predictive analytics solution with Azure Machine Learning.
